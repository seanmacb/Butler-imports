    Parameters
    ----------
    butler : `lsst.daf.butler.Butler`
        The source Butler from which datasets are exported.
    target_butler : `lsst.daf.butler.Butler`
        The target Butler to which datasets are exported. It is checked
        to avoid exporting existing datasets. No checks are done to
        verify if datasets are really identical.
    wants : `dict`
        A dictionary to identify selections with optional keys:

        ``"datasets"``, optional
            A list of dataset selection expressions (`list` of `dict`).
            The list is iterated over to find matching datasets in the butler,
            with the matching criteria provided via the selection expressions.
            Each selection expression has the keyworded argument dictionary to
            be passed to butler to query datasets; it has the same meanings
            as the parameters of `lsst.daf.butler.Registry.queryDatasets`.
        ``"collections"``, optional
            A list of collection selection expressions (`list` of `dict`).
            The list is iterated over to find matching collections in the butler,
            with the matching criteria provided via the selection expressions.
            Each selection expression has the keyworded argument dictionary to
            be passed to butler to query collectionss; it has the same meanings
